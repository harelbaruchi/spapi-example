 FLOW :

note: All actions below must take place after creating :
* AWS account
* IAM user
* IAM policy
* IAM role

------------------------------------------------------

 AT FIRST :

 the user enters our web app / web site.
 the user is being asked weather he agrees to our SELLING PARTNER APP
 to take control over his personal data, and perform actions on
 his behalf as well.
 in case access is granted, there are several actions that need to take
 place by that order :

 1. The user is being re-directed to another page in our app
 (which has been defined while creating the app, and
 can be changed anytime).

 2. Selling Partner API uses query params to send us the user's oAuth code.
 (once the user is being re-directed, client-side should send the oAuth code
back to our server).

 *** NOTE : oAuth code is a  TEMPORARY  code - it expires within a few moments.

3. Our server sends the oAuth code and gets a REFRESH TOKEN in exchange from Selling Partner API.
REFRESH TOKEN is permanent.
Using this refresh token, we can access the client's data anytime.
(Refresh token needs to be safe and sound along side the rest of the client's data).

As for this moment, our server can access almost any data of the client.
